----About the project----

This project involves creating a linear regression model to analyze and predict the severity of road accidents based on various factors such as speed, weather conditions, road conditions, vehicle conditions, and time of day. The model can be used to identify high-risk conditions and educate the public about road safety. 

----Dataset----
variables included:
accident_severity: The severity of the accident (dependent variable).
speed: The speed of the vehicle at the time of the accident.
weather_condition: The weather condition during the accident (e.g., clear, rainy, foggy, snowy).
road_condition: The condition of the road (e.g., dry, wet, icy).
vehicle_condition: The condition of the vehicle (e.g., good, fair, poor).
time_of_day: The time of day when the accident occurred (e.g., morning, afternoon, evening, night).
